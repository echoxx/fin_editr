TODO: Debug Investing.com Login Automation
==========================================
Date: 2026-01-22

ISSUE:
------
The automated login to Investing.com Pro is not yet working. Need to debug:

1. KEYRING ISSUE (WSL):
   - OS keyring not available on WSL, now falls back to encrypted file storage
   - File storage implemented in credentials.py (~/.fin_editr/credentials.enc)
   - This part should work now, but needs testing

2. GMAIL/OAUTH LOGIN:
   - User logs into Investing.com via Gmail address
   - Investing.com may use Google OAuth for this
   - Playwright automation cannot handle OAuth popups easily
   - POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:
     a) User sets a direct password on Investing.com account
        (https://www.investing.com/members-admin/account)
     b) Investigate if Investing.com has a direct email/password option
     c) Look into handling Google OAuth with Playwright (complex)

3. INVESTING.COM SITE STRUCTURE:
   - Need to verify the CSS selectors in investing_scraper.py match current site
   - Site may have changed since initial development
   - Test with --no-headless flag to watch browser behavior

WORKAROUND (CURRENT):
---------------------
Use --skip-download flag with manually downloaded files:

    python netnet_main.py analyze TICKER --skip-download --folder ./FOLDER

This skips the web automation entirely and uses existing IS/BS files.

TO TEST WHEN READY:
-------------------
1. Run: python netnet_main.py setup-credentials
2. Run: python netnet_main.py verify-credentials
3. Run: python netnet_main.py analyze 7859 --exchange TYO --no-headless
   (watch browser to see where it fails)

FILES INVOLVED:
---------------
- netnet_tools/credentials.py - credential storage
- netnet_tools/investing_scraper.py - web automation
- netnet_tools/netnet_workflow.py - orchestration (has skip_download logic)
